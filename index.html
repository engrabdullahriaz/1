            <p>Sales are the bedrock of every business. Even when a company has investors, it is the customers who are paying everyone’s salary. The role of a salesperson, or team, is to ensure revenue keeps flowing in, at a reliable pace to grow and scale the business.</p>

            <p>When we think about software, we rarely think about the technology as a standalone sector. Instead, we think about the role it plays in our economy and society. Developers and designers create the products, but it is the job of sales and marketing professionals to sell the benefits - and the services - into target sectors and markets. There are software products and solutions for nearly every sector. Software that improves HR and recruitment processes. Software as a Service (SaaS) - the most popular form of pricing and delivering technology services - products are playing key roles in the healthcare, health and safety, marketing, retail, travel, property, advertising sectors, and dozens of other markets.</p>
              
            <p>Entrepreneurs and developers who create software products are attempting to solve problems, create more value and help others work more efficiently.</p>
              
            <p>It is the role of sales teams to bring these products to market, win customers, and grow market share within the sector(s) the product is designed to serve.</p>

            <p>n every sector, sales involves a familiar, repetitive pattern. Generally speaking, sales is split between hunting and farming activities: Also known as prospecting (for new leads, business development) and account management (generating more revenue from existing customers).</p>

            <p>Depending on priorities - fast growth (a common demand in the software sector) - or steadier growth, a sales executive will probably spend more time bringing in new business than working on increasing revenue from customers. It also depends on the size of the company and number of customers. Some need dedicated account managers, to ensure customers can be looked after and they can up-sell other products and services when the need arises.</p>

            <p>As in the case of the application, a sales software can be analogous to a tool helping increase the chances of acquiring paying customers.

Sales representatives know that generating leads is not enough, as it is imperative to identify the most promising of those leads. This will help with the efficient use of sales resource and increase the chances of conversion to paying customers.</p>

          <p> Some of the most important features to look out for in a sale software:

Data from sales prospects need to be analyzed in order to understand their intent and score them. Such analysis can also be used to gain insight into prospects and identify new possible opportunities.</p>

            <p>360-view of prospects: You need a sales software that gives a broad and narrow view of prospects. This will help you create personalize sales approaches towards these prospects, thus increasing chances of conversion. Sales representatives want to understand prospects in an in-depth manner, and good sales software helps them achieve this. In addition to these, one should also be able to filter prospects according to different options like geography, age, and other demographic data.</p>

            <p>Integration with other software: Sales software do not work alone as they need data from various other departments of a company. This is why you need a sales software that can be integrated with your other software – marketing, contact management, social media, and so on.</p>

            <p>Security: Security is another very important feature of sales software. You would be dealing with a lot of sensitive customer and business data, so the last thing you want is a leak of such sensitive information.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Objectives">
          <header>Objectives</header>
          <article>
           <p>Ask any sales manager or rep what their goals are and their answers will likely be the same: get more leads, be more productive and sell more.</p> 
           <p>ales objectives give your sales team a clear road map of what they need to do to help your company achieve its overall goals. Each objective comprises specific, measurable action items that help salespeople make sure individual and team-wide goals are achieved.

            Sales objectives are broad strokes of the brush, like increasing customer numbers or cutting churn. They are usually long-term goals, made up of shorter-term steps. According to research by Accent Technologies, sales management objectives that work for best-in-class companies revolve around understanding buyer challenges and personalizing sales engagement and processes.
            
            However, the sales objectives you set need to make sense for your business or department. You might be setting sales objectives that focus on:
            <ul>
            <li>Increasing sales and profit</li> 
            <li>Increasing customer numbers</li>
            <li>Increasing upsells and cross-sells</li>
            <li>Increasing sales rep productivity</li>
            <li>Cutting the time sales reps spend on non-sales tasks</li>
            <li>Enhancing your sales processes</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Remember, there’s a difference between setting sales objectives and setting sales objectives that work. Just because you plan something doesn’t mean it will get done.</p>
            
            <p>This is why any sales objective that has a chance of succeeding needs to be set in steps. In other words, you should consider setting sales objectives using a SMART mindset.</p>
            <ol>
            <li>Specific: A clear explanation of the objective and its steps</li>
            <li>Measurable: Ensure there are metrics that you can measure the objective’s success</li>
            <li>Achievable: The objective should be realistic, but still challenging</li>
            <li>Relevant: Make sure that the objective is consistent with your business’s and team’s goals and strategy</li>
            <li>Time-based: Set out an accurate and clear timescale for the objective</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Let’s say your company has a sales goal of adding more new customers to your pipeline every month. Let’s run through some goals and examples using SMART objectives:</p>
            
            Specific: You might set a specific goal to get 100 new customers a month. If you divide that by your number of sales reps, it starts to paint a clearer picture of whether that sales objective is realistically achievable.
            Measurable: How many new customers do your reps need to bring in each day/week to achieve the objective?
            Attainable: If you have four sales reps on your team, do they each have the ability to bring in 25 new customers a month? Make sure your team has the skills and ability to make the objective attainable.
            Realistic: Is it realistic to increase your customer base by 100 a month, or is it more of a pipe dream?
            Timely: Instead of saying you want to bring new customers on board, you’ve set an objective to bring 100 new customers on board each month. Already, your sales team knows there’s a time limit to the objective.</p>

         Once your sales team qualifies the leads that are in the pipeline, it's the responsibility of the sales manager to assign qualified leads to their sales reps. Lead assignment can be done based on a variety of lead parameters, such as country, industry type, size of the organization, and number of users.

          Lead assignment ensures that the right leads reach the right sales rep. Once the lead is assigned to a sales rep, it's their duty to understand the needs of the prospect so that they can recommend a product that's the best-fit solution for their business. Start with the most basic questions about their industry and go deeper to understand more about their business as your progress.
            </p>
      
            <p>
              Present the solution
          Sales reps have to remember that they are selling solutions to business' problems. Once you understand a prospect's current problem, sales reps have to create a compelling presentation that demonstrates their product's problem-solving capabilities.

          Set up a suitable time for you to give a demonstration of your solution. Completely review your presentation beforehand so that you avoid any last-minute setbacks. Try to explain clearly with use-cases what it means to have your product present in the day-to-day activities of the prospect and their company. Allow them to take notes of your presentation and ask questions whenever necessary. Demonstrate how your current customers have solved similar problems using your product. This way you can build confidence in your future buyers.
